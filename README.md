# How to use the project

Go to desired folder and open the folder in command prompt or bash and run
`git clone https://github.com/FarukIm/SEProject.git`

## After download

Run `npm install` in **both** Client and Server folders

### Later

Run `git checkout branch_name` to got to your own branch.
After everything is done `npm start` to run the project.

## Add files to .gitignore which you don't want to track like node_modules

### More basics

1.  `git fetch origin` get all branches and their changes
2.  `git status` see how your local repo compares to other branches
3.  `git add .` track all new files
4.  `git commit -m "text"` commit your changes, good to do often so you can return to state of previous commits
5.  `git push` this will push all your changes to git, only do once major things are done and working
